For encapsulation , 
	Lets try to make product details hidden ,
	Applying encapsulation in Product class so that the order and customer way  is not known 
	as name is encapsulated , Customer.name is unaccessible
	CS0122	'Customer.name' is inaccessible due to its protection level	Ecommerce	H:\.NET Learn\Ecommerce\Program.cs	33
	BUT , Customer.Name is accessible and we can update it , checking its validation rules

For inheritance , 
	Make it in Product class ,
	Product can be cosmetics , food related , stationery
	So the order which is expecting list of product , we can also add foodproduct and stationery
